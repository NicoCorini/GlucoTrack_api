## üî≠ Optional Roadmap

| Area               | Idea                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract Safety    | Versioned routes (`/api/v1`) + future backward compatibility tests     |
| Security Hardening | JWT refresh rotation, secret vault integration, stricter claim scoping |
| Observability      | Structured logging enrichment + OpenTelemetry traces                   |
| Performance        | Caching read‚Äëheavy aggregates (doctor dashboard)                       |
| Predictive         | Risk scoring endpoints (hypo/hyper trend prediction)                   |

## üß± Architecture

```
Controllers  -->  (inline service logic, candidate extraction)  -->  EF Core DbContext
            DTOs (transport)      Entities (persistence)
```

Principles:

- Separation of concerns between transport (DTOs) and persistence (Entities).
- Explicit role checks at controller entry.
- Semantic validation aggregated before state mutation.
- Alert logic centralized to keep consistent severity & recipient rules.

## üìÇ Key Folders

| Folder                   | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Controllers              | HTTP endpoints (Auth, Admin, Patient, Doctor, Alert, Db) |
| DTOs                     | Transport models (future versioning surface)             |
| Models                   | EF Core entity classes (relational mapping)              |
| Data                     | `GlucoTrackDBContext` (DbSets, configuration)            |
| Utils                    | Helper utilities (mapping / constants)                   |
| Tests (separate project) | xUnit unit tests                                         |

## üóÑ Data Model (Abbreviated)

Users, Roles, Therapies, MedicationSchedules, MedicationIntakes, GlycemicMeasurements, Symptoms, ClinicalComorbidities, RiskFactors, ReportedConditions, Alerts, AlertTypes, AlertRecipients, ChangeLogs, PatientDoctors, PatientRiskFactors.

Integrity:

- Foreign keys, required constraints, uniqueness where clinically needed.
- Application layer semantic checks (e.g. schedule vs intake consistency).
- Soft deletion patterns prepared for historical continuity (where applicable).

| Soft Delete Therapy           | DELETE `/Doctor/therapy?therapyId=`           |

## üîê Security & Validation

- Role based authorization (coarse controller boundaries).
- Input DTO validation (null / range) + semantic domain checks (e.g. measurement timing).
- Limited surface: no public self‚Äëregistration reduces attack area.
- Future: add policy‚Äëbased authorization & claims tightening.

## üß™ Testing

xUnit project (`GlucoTrack_api.Tests`) covers controllers & critical domain logic (alert handling, validation). Roadmap includes contract tests & broader service isolation once service layer extracted.

Run tests:

```
dotnet test
```

## üöÄ Run (Development)

Prerequisites: .NET 8 SDK, SQL Server (or local container) configured.

1. Set connection string in `appsettings.Development.json`.
2. Apply schema: run SQL script `GlucoTrackDB_schema.sql` (or apply migrations when added).
3. Launch:

```
dotnet run
```

4. (Optional) Enable Swagger middleware for interactive docs at `/swagger`.

## üß© Design Notes

| Concern               | Decision                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Transport Isolation   | DTO vs Entity mapping keeps contract stable if persistence evolves |
| Alert Processing      | Central logic prevents drift across controllers                    |
| Monitoring Separation | External task avoids heavy periodic jobs in request pipeline       |
| Future Refactor       | Extract dedicated service layer + repository if complexity grows   |

## üìà Recruiter Snapshot
